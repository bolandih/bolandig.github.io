              <p></p>
              <p>We proposed deep neural networks in the form of convolutional neural networks (CNN) to bypass the FEA. The model is able to predict high-resolution stress distributions on loaded steel plates with variable loading, geometries and boundary conditions. The proposed technique‚Äôs performance was compared to Finite-Element simulations using a partial differential equation (PDE) solver. The trained DL model can predict the stress distributions with a mean absolute error of 0.9% and an absolute peak error of 0.46% for the Von-Mises stress distribution.</p>

			<papertitle>Deep Learning Paradigm for Prediction of Stress Distribution in Damaged Structural Components with stress concentrations</papertitle>

		      <p></p>
		      <p> This paper aims to integrate physics knowledge into a convolutional neural network (CNN) to boost learning within a feasible solution space in a specific domain. Our proposed method uses deep neural networks in the form of (CNNs) augmented with custom loss functions which uses physics rules to bypass the need for Finite Element Analysis and predict high-resolution stress distributions on damaged steel plates with variable loading and boundary conditions. We embedded physics constraints into the loss function to enforce the model training, precisely capturing stress concentrations around the tips of various structural damage configurations.</p>

			<papertitle>NeuralSI: Structural Parameter Identification in Nonlinear Dynamical Systems</papertitle>

		      <p></p>
		      <p> Structural monitoring for complex built environments often suffers from mismatch between design, laboratory testing, and actual built parameters. Additionally, real-world structural identification problems encounter many challenges. For example, the lack of accurate baseline models, high dimensionality, and complex multivariate partial differential equations (PDEs) pose significant difficulties in training and learning conventional data-driven algorithms. This paper explores a new framework, dubbed NeuralSI, for structural identification by augmenting PDEs that govern structural dynamics with neural networks. Our approach seeks to estimate nonlinear parameters from governing equations. We consider the vibration of nonlinear beams with two unknown parameters, one that represents geometric and material variations, and another that captures energy losses in the system mainly through damping. The data for parameter estimation is obtained from a limited set of measurements, which is conducive to applications in structural health monitoring where the exact state of an existing structure is typically unknown and only a limited amount of data samples can be collected in the field. The trained model can also be extrapolated under both standard and extreme conditions using the identified structural parameters. We compare with pure data-driven Neural Networks and other classical Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Our approach reduces both interpolation and extrapolation errors in displacement distribution by two to five orders of magnitude over the baselines. </p>

		<papertitle>Methods For The Rapid Detection Of Boundary Condition Variations in Structural Systems</papertitle>

	      <p></p>
	      <p> This study proposes a novel anomaly detection approach focusing on structural components which do not have a baseline model and with complex boundary conditions that cannot be built into a finite element or a digital twin model. The approach uses only sensor-collected compressed response distribution data to detect and localize changes in boundary conditions under extreme loading events. The developed methods use unsupervised anomaly detection networks combined with novel data compression algorithms. The deep network collects training data from real direct measured responses of the structural system over time to build a model and then computes the reconstruction errors and identifies anomalies. A simplified gusset plate under variable clamped-clamped boundary conditions is used in this study as a preliminary proof of concept. In this work, anomalies are induced by changing the connection conditions (boundary conditions) of the gusset plate (e.g. bolts loosening). This study improved the deep learning network performance by incorporating mechanics-based loss functions into the network, fed with experimental data obtained from the distributed sensors installed on the structural element. Results show that the mechanics-based modified loss function significantly improves the identification and localization abilities of boundary condition anomalies and eliminates undesired factors and false predictions. </p>
