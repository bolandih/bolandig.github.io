              <p></p>
              <p>We proposed deep neural networks in the form of convolutional neural networks (CNN) to bypass the FEA. The model is able to predict high-resolution stress distributions on loaded steel plates with variable loading, geometries and boundary conditions. The proposed technique‚Äôs performance was compared to Finite-Element simulations using a partial differential equation (PDE) solver. The trained DL model can predict the stress distributions with a mean absolute error of 0.9% and an absolute peak error of 0.46% for the Von-Mises stress distribution.</p>

			<papertitle>Deep Learning Paradigm for Prediction of Stress Distribution in Damaged Structural Components with stress concentrations</papertitle>

		      <p></p>
		      <p> This paper aims to integrate physics knowledge into a convolutional neural network (CNN) to boost learning within a feasible solution space in a specific domain. Our proposed method uses deep neural networks in the form of (CNNs) augmented with custom loss functions which uses physics rules to bypass the need for Finite Element Analysis and predict high-resolution stress distributions on damaged steel plates with variable loading and boundary conditions. We embedded physics constraints into the loss function to enforce the model training, precisely capturing stress concentrations around the tips of various structural damage configurations.</p>

			<papertitle>NeuralSI: Structural Parameter Identification in Nonlinear Dynamical Systems</papertitle>

		      <p></p>
		      <p>We develop a new framework, dubbed NeuralSI, for structural identification by augmenting PDEs that govern structural dynamics with neural networks. Our approach seeks to estimate nonlinear parameters from governing equations. We consider the vibration of nonlinear beams with two unknown parameters, one that represents geometric and material variations, and another that captures energy losses in the system mainly through damping. The trained model can also be extrapolated under both standard and extreme conditions using the identified structural parameters. We compare with pure data-driven Neural Networks and other classical Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Our approach reduces both interpolation and extrapolation errors in displacement distribution by two to five orders of magnitude over the baselines. </p>

		<papertitle>Methods For The Rapid Detection of Boundary Condition Variations in Structural Systems</papertitle>

	      <p></p>
	      <p> We propose a novel anomaly detection approach focusing on structural components which do not have a baseline model and with complex boundary conditions that cannot be built into a finite element or a digital twin model. The approach uses only sensor-collected compressed response distribution data to detect and localize changes in boundary conditions under extreme loading events. The developed methods use unsupervised anomaly detection networks combined with novel data compression algorithms. This study improved the deep learning network performance by incorporating mechanics-based loss functions into the network, fed with experimental data obtained from the distributed sensors installed on the structural element. Results show that the mechanics-based modified loss function significantly improves the identification and localization abilities of boundary condition anomalies and eliminates undesired factors and false predictions. </p>

		<papertitle>A Novel Data Reduction Approach for Structural Health Monitoring Systems</papertitle>

	      <p></p>
	      <p> This paper proposes a novel concept based on the probability theory for data reduction in SHM systems. The beauty salient feature of the proposed method is that it alleviates the burden of collecting and analysis of the entire strain data via a relative damage approach. In this methodology, the rate of variation of strain distributions is related to the rate of damage. To verify the accuracy of the approach, experimental and numerical studies were conducted on a thin steel plate subjected to cyclic in-plane tension loading. The results show that the presented technique can efficiently detect damage progression. The damage detection accuracy can be improved by increasing the predefined strain levels. The proposed concept can lead to over 2500% reduction in data storage requirement, which can be particularly important for data generation and data handling in online SHM systems. </p>

		<papertitle>An Intelligent Model for the Prediction of Bond Strength of FRP Bars in Concrete: A Soft Computing Approach </papertitle>

	      <p></p>
	      <p>This paper presents a soft computing method called multi-gene genetic programming (MGGP) to develop an intelligent prediction model for the bond strength of FRP bars in concrete. The main advantage of the MGGP method over other similar methods is that it can formulate the bond strength by combining the capabilities of both standard genetic programming and classical regression. The proposed MGGP model accurately predicts the bond strength of FRP bars in concrete. The newly defined predictor variables were found to be efficient in characterizing the bond strength. The derived equation has better performance than the widely-used American Concrete Institute (ACI) model. </p>

		<papertitle>A new predictive model for compressive strength of HPC using gene expression programming </papertitle>

	      <p></p>
	      <p>In this study, gene expression programming (GEP) is utilized to derive a new model for the prediction of compressive strength of high performance concrete (HPC) mixes. The model is developed using a comprehensive database obtained from the literature. The validity of the proposed model is verified by applying it to estimate the compressive strength of a portion of test results that are not included in the analysis. Linear and nonlinear least squares regression analyses are performed to benchmark the GEP model. Contributions of the parameters affecting the compressive strength are evaluated through a sensitivity analysis. GEP is found to be an effective method for evaluating the compressive strength of HPC mixes. The prediction performance of the optimal GEP model is better than the regression models. </p>
